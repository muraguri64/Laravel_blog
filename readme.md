# How To Build a (Basic) Blog Management System with Laravel

Laravel is one of the fastest growing and most popular frameworks on the internet right now. In this repo we not only explore what makes Laravel great, but learn concepts of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete), MVC (Model, View, Controller), and other web technologies to create a blog application built on top of Laravel.
You can clone or download the repository and improve on any areas that you may feel that i have left out or not added.
